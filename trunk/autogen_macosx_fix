The new version of autoconf requires that you replace AM_CONFIG_HEADER in configure.ac at line 8 with AC_CONFIG_HEADERS. If you don't make this change you will see the following error message in the terminal:

configure.ac:8: error: 'AM_CONFIG_HEADER': this macro is obsolete.
    You should use the 'AC_CONFIG_HEADERS' macro instead.
